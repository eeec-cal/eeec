## Extremely Elaborate Elegant Calendar

eeec - or Extremely Elaborate Elegant Calendar - is a calendar utility in the terminal made 100% in the Bash programming language. It is very fast and useful.

# Getting Started
To install eeec, first clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/eeec-cal/eeec && cd eeec/
```

And then run the `install.sh`:
```
bash install.sh
```

And you're all set! Enjoy this cozy calendar app for ricing and/or other stuff!

# Configuration
The eeec configuration sits at `~/.eeecrc`. You can find the default config in the repo. When you install eeec with the `install.sh` file, it also downloads the default config.

At the moment, you can only change the date background color & the date font style, but I plan on adding more customization options.

All necessary information to configure eeec is in the default config file.

# Support my work
Don't. I do this for free and I do not want any money from you. Just enjoy the free software :D
